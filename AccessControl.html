A source file is defined as a single      source code file with in a module to access multiple types and functions.</p>    <p>Three different access levels are provided by Swift language. </p>    <ul>      <li>Public - Enables entities to be processed with in any source file from        their defining module, a source file from another module that imports        the defining module</li>      <li>Internal - Enables entities to be used within any source file from        their defining module, but not in any source file outside of that module</li>      <li>Private - Restricts the use of an entity to its own defining source        file. Private access plays role to hide the implementation details of a        specific code functionality.</li>    </ul>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt;Back</a></p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><br>    </p>  </body></html>
