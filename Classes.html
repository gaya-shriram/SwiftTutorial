Similar to      constants, variables and functions the user can define class properties      and methods. </p>    <p><strong>Benefits Of Having Classes</strong></p>    <p>* Inheritance acquires the properties of one class to another class<br>      * Type casting enables the user to check class type at run time<br>      * Deinitializers take care of releasing memory resources<br>      * Reference counting allows the class instance to have more than one      reference</p>    <p><strong>Accessing Class Properties as Reference Types</strong> - Class      properties can be accessed by the '.' syntax. Property name is separated      by a '.' after the instance name.<strong><br>      </strong></p>    <h3>Methods</h3>    <p>In Swift language Functions associated with particular types are referred      to as Methods.</p>    <p>In Swift language, Classes, Structures and Enumeration instances are      accessed through the instance methods.<br>      Instance methods provide functionality.<br>      * To access and modify instance properties.<br>      * functionality related to the instance's need.<br>      Instance method can be written inside the {} curly braces. It has implicit      access to methods and properties of the type instance. When a specific      instance of the type is called it will get access to that particular      instance.</p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt;Back</a></p>    <p><br>    </p>  </body></html>
