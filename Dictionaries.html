Swift puts strict checking which does not allow you to enter a      wrong type in a dictionary even by mistake.</p>    <p>Use unique identifier known as a key to store a value which later can be      referenced and looked up through the same key. Unlike items in an array,      items in a dictionary do not have a specified order. You can use a      dictionary when you need to look up values based on their identifiers.</p>    <p>Accessing Dictionaries - You can retrieve a value from a dictionary by      using subscript syntax, passing the key of the value you want to retrieve      within square brackets immediately after the name of the dictionary.</p>    <p>Modifying Dictionaries - You can use updateValue(forKey:) method to add      an existing value to a given key of the dictionary. This method returns an      optional value of the dictionary's value type.</p>    <p>Remove Key-Value Pairs - You can use removeValueForKey() method to remove      a key-value pair from a dictionary. This method removes the key-value pair      if it exists and returns the removed value, or returns nil if no value      existed.</p>    <p>Iterating Over a Dictionary - You can use a for-in loop to iterate over      the entire set of key-value pairs in a Dictionary.</p>    <p>Convert to Arrays - You can extract a list of key-value pairs from a      given dictionary to build separate arrays for both keys and values. </p>    <p>The Count Property - You can use the read-only count property of a      dictionary to find out the number of items in a dictionary.</p>    <p>The Empty Property - You can use read-only empty property of a dictionary      to find out whether a dictionary is empty or not.</p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt;Back</a></p>    <p><br>    </p>  </body></html>
