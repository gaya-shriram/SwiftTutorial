Generally a      class can inherit methods, properties and functionalities from another      class. Classes can be further categorized in to sub class and super class.<br>      * Sub Class − when a class inherits properties, methods and functions from      another class it is called as sub class <br>      * Super Class − Class containing properties, methods and functions to      inherit other classes from itself is called as a super class <br>      Swift classes contain superclass which calls and access methods,      properties, functions and overriding methods. Also, property observers are      also used to add a property and modify the stored or computed property      methods.</p>    <p>Base Class - A Class that does not inherit methods, properties or      functions from another class is called as 'Base Class'.</p>    <p>Subclass - The act of basing a new class on an existing class is defined      as 'Subclass'. The subclass inherits the properties, methods and functions      of its base class. To define a subclass ':' is used before the base class      name</p>    <h3>ARC Overview</h3>    <p>Memory management functions and its usage are handled in Swift language      through Automatic reference counting (ARC). ARC is used to initialize and      deinitialize the system resources thereby releasing memory spaces used by      the class instances when the instances are no longer needed. ARC keeps      track of information about the relationships between our code instances to      manage the memory resources effectively</p>    <p><br>    </p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt;Back</a></p>    <p><br>    </p>  </body></html>
