It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>    <p>do...while loop - Like a while statement, except that it tests the      condition at the end of the loop body.<br>      <br>      Loop Control Statements:</p>    <p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When      execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that      scope are destroyed.</p>    <p>Continue Statement - This statement tells a loop to stop what it is doing      and start again at the beginning of the next iteration through the loop.</p>    <p>Break Statement - Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution      to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>    <p>Fallthrough Statement - It simulates the behavior of swift switch to      C-style switch.</p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt; Back<br>      </a></p>    <p> </p>  </body></html>
