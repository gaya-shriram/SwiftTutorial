Objective-C is rich in built-in      operators and provides the following types of operators:</p>    <p>* Arithmetic Operators<br>      * Comparison Operators<br>      * Logical Operators<br>      * Bitwise Operators<br>      * Assignment Operators<br>      * Range Operators<br>      * Misc Operators</p>    <h3>Decision Making</h3>    <p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or      more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a      statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to      be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition      is determined to be false.</p>    * If Statement - Consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more    statements.<br>    * If.... else Statement - An if statement can be followed by an optional    else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.<br>    * If.... else If.... else Statement&nbsp; - An if statement can be followed    by an optional else if...elsestatement, which is very useful to test various    conditions using single if...else if statement.<br>    * Nested If Statement - You can use one if or else if statement inside    another if or else if statement(s).<br>    * Switch Statement - Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a    list of values.<br>    <br>    The ? : Operator - The value of a ? expression is determined like this: Exp1    is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of    the entire ?expression. If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its    value becomes the value of the expression.<br>    <br>  </body></html>
