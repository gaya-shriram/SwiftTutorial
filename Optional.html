It says either "there is a      value, and it equals x" or "there isn't a value at all".</p>    <p>Forced Unwrapping - If you defined a variable as optional, then to get      the value from this variable, you will have to unwrap it. This just means      putting an exclamation mark at the end of the variable.</p>    <p>Automatic Unwrapping - You can declare optional variables using      exclamation mark instead of a question mark. Such optional variables will      unwrap automatically and you do not need to use any further exclamation      mark at the end of the variable to get the assigned value.</p>    <p>Optional Binding - Use optional binding to find out whether an optional      contains a value, and if so, to make that value available as a temporary      constant or variable.</p>    <h3>Constant</h3>    <p>Constants refer to fixed values that a program may not alter during its      execution. Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer      constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal.      There are enumeration constants as well.<br>      <br>      Constants are treated just like regular variables except the fact that      their values cannot be modified after their definition.</p>    <p>Type Annotations - You can provide a type annotation when you declare a      constant, to be clear about the kind of values the constant can store. </p>    <p>Naming Constants - The name of a constant can be composed of letters,      digits, and the underscore character. It must begin with either a letter      or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because Swift      is a case-sensitive programming language.</p>    <p>Printing Constants - You can print the current value of a constant or      variable using printlnfunction. You can interpolate a variable value by      wrapping the name in parentheses and escape it with a backslash before the      opening parenthesis.</p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt; Back<br>      </a></p>  </body></html>
