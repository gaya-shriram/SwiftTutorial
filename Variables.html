Each variable in Swift has a specific type, which determines      the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can      be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be      applied to the variable.</p>    <p>Swift Supports the following basic data types</p>    <ul>      <li>Int or UInt</li>      <li>Float</li>      <li>Double</li>      <li>Bool</li>      <li>String</li>      <li>Character</li>    </ul>    <h3>Variable Declaration</h3>    <p>A variable declaration tells the compiler where and how much to create      the storage for the variable. Before you use variables, you must declare      them using var keyword as follows</p>    <p>var variableName = &lt;initial value&gt;</p>    <h3>Naming Variables</h3>    <p>The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the      underscore character. It must begin with either a letter or an underscore.      Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because Swift is a case-sensitive      programming language.</p>    <p><a  href="guide.html">&gt;&gt;Back</a></p>    <p> </p>  </body></html>
